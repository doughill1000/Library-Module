# Library Module

Javascript modules that can be used to create an application for a mock public library system. Books, library books, and physical copies can be created and managed. Physical copies of books are assigned serial numbers and can be checked out and returned. 

The modules still require unit tests, however it is a strong foundation for a potential library app.

React prototype in library-app. Just getting the my feet wet with React, great learning experience.
