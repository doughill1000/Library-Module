# Library Module

Javascript modules that can be used to create an application for a mock public library system. Books, library books, and physical copies can be created and managed. Physical copies of books are assigned serial numbers and can be checked out and returned. 

The modules still require unit tests, however it is a strong foundation for a potential library app.

I would also like to create a UI using react, which should integrate nicely with the modules and classes already established.
